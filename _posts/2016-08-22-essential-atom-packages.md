<!-- Intro -->
   As a long-time Sublime Text user, I've made the transition to using &nbsp; <img class="inline" src="http://i32.photobucket.com/albums/d2/therealbrettstevenson/Github/Atomic%20Monokai/atom_zps8lz1oett.png" width="20" alt="atom"/> [**Atom**](https://atom.io/) as my go-to code editor, and while I enjoy it's more hackable aspects, I had been unable to find a monokai syntax theme that felt familiar amongst the available prospects. 
   This is why I decided to create the [**Atomic Monokai**](https://atom.io/packages/atomic-monokai-syntax) syntax-theme.  
   I also know from experience that changes like these can be a little bewildering, so I thought others might benefit from a simple resource to started configuring their Atomic workspace.

## **Just for Fun**
  * [**Activate Power Mode**](https://atom.io/packages/activate-power-mode) &#8211; a fun package which adds a little bit more excitement to writing code. Although
  personally, I found the constant animations and shaking to be a little overwhelming, so I chose to disabled that package and instead
  replaced it with [***Activate Power Mode Delete***](https://atom.io/packages/activate-power-mode-delete).
