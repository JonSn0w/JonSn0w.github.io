## Setup:
This package requires that you have Python3, as well as BeautifulSoup4. On OS X and Linux systems Python3 should be installed by default. Once Python is installed you can download [BeautifulSoup](https://www.crummy.com/software/BeautifulSoup/) with the command:
```shell
  $ pip3 install bs4
```
***Note:*** To my knowledge, Python3 is also included in the new *Bash on Windows* linux-subsystem for Windows 10.


Furthermore, you can also make the program executable from anywhere in your file&ndash;system with the command `./UDTherapy.py` by adding the program directory to your *PATH* and by modifying the program permissions using the command:
```shell
  $ chmod +x UDTherapy.py
```
